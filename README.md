## Stack

**[Motion](https://www.motion.dev/)**: The key to all this is to experiment with this animation library.

**[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: For quick and simple UI prototyping in that case.

**[Clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)**: Essential for handling CSS class conditionals.

**[Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)**: From here we take the icons to animate them.
